OpenJazz Homebrew Formula
=========================

Yay, OpenJazz on your Mac! To play, set up [Homebrew](http://brew.sh),
which will require installing Command Line Tools for XCode.

Then, tap and install the formula:

    brew tap mikepurvis/openjazz
    brew install --HEAD openjazz

When the build is complete, you can run it like so:

    OpenJazz [path to game data]

Note that the OpenJazz project is only game logic, the data remains the
property of Epic Games. To use OpenJazz, you need a copy of the Jazz
Jackrabbit data files.
